Samanta Fluture

I like to make things

- I use my hands to draw, paint and sew
- I code creativity with usual frontend resources
- I dream big while experimenting with Processing and Arduino stuff
- I am inspired by games when designing 8bit pieces and weird sounds

My daily job is to build experiences

- I'm the co-founder of Blending Visions
- I'm member of Red Bull Digital Academy at Brazil
- I was a producer at Möve
- I've worked as a creative content coordinator at Gaia Creative

But they call me "artist"
 
- My artwork Sputnik Project was founded and exihibited by RedBull on 2014
- I did an Artistic Residence at MIS (Sao Paulo) on 2013
- I had a few artworks exihibited on Streaming Festival in Amsterdam on 2013
- My sculpture Labirinto was exihibited at MUBE (Sao Paulo) on 2012
- My collage JanelasSP was featured on OpenArts 
- My 1º app OcupaCéu is seeking support to go live

I also write for cool blogs

- Most of the topics I cover: tech news and trends, apps and games reviews, design and art inspiration, tutorials & diy stuff.  
- I'm a regular collaborator at: 
	Brainstorm9 is the biggest and coolest blog about communication in Brazil
	Design Culture is one of the best rated design blogs in Brazil
	Conversa de Sofá is an emerging blog about indie games 
	TecnoArteNews was the 1º blog about tech-art projects in Brazil (RIP)
